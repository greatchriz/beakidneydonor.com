<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — When a Raleigh musician needed a kidney, a friend of a friend offered to donate hers. The offer led to a kidney transplant chain stretching from the Triangle all the way to Denmark.</p>
<p>When Jason Adamo sings, you can hear his passion for his music; pictures show his love for his family, but for the past couple of years, polycistic kidney disease left Jason weak and exhausted.</p>
<p>“I could barely get off the couch,” he said</p>
<p>He needed a transplant and knew his best bet was finding a living donor. At the time he didn’t know Jenna Kovacic, or that she was already going through the process to become a kidney donor at Duke — the same health system treating him.</p>
<p>A mutual friend connected them and Kovacic offered to donate her kidney to Adamo.</p>
<p>“It felt right right from the get-go,” said Adamo. “Like a fairytale,” added Kovacic.</p>
<p>Then, just days before the surgery, they learned the kidney wasn’t a perfect match. “It was devastating at first,” Kovacic recalled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the ocean, in Denmark, friends Peter Wichmann and Morton Berktoft were dealing with a similar issue. Wichmann wanted to donate his kidney to Berktoft, but they didn’t match either.</p>
<p>Then something called a paired kidney exchange ended up helping all of them.</p>
<p>When someone wants to donate to a specific person, but isn’t a match, they can donate to someone else, whose intended donor isn’t a match for them. The <a href="https://paireddonation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alliance For Paired Kidney Donation</a>, or AKPD, uses an algorithm to create transplant chains, which may require several patients and donors to find compatible matches, and make sure the original intended recipient receives a kidney.</p>
<p>“It’s actually a Nobel prize-winning algorithm,” explained Krista Sweeney with AKPD. “They put these pairs into our system… We’re able to identify the best matches for each pair.”</p>
<p>In this case, Kovacic donated her kidney to someone in Colorado. Their loved one donated a kidney to Berktoft, who flew to the U.S. for the surgery along with Wichmann, who donated a kidney to Adamo.</p>
<p>“It was already mind-blowing, but to hear that my kidney was coming from Denmark it was just amazing,” Adamo said.</p>
<p>Three months after the surgeries the donors and recipients are all doing well and got a chance to talk to each other in a virtual meeting.</p>
<p>Not only are they healthy, but they’ve formed friendships they’d never imagined. Adamo, as a musician, finds it remarkable that his donor, Wichmann, is an artist. Now the two send each other photos and albums of their work.</p>
<p>Adamo and Kovacic have become close friends and their families enjoy spending time together.</p>
<p>They both find it fascinating to be connected with Berktoft, who serves as a police officer in Denmark and works as a body guard for the Prime Minister, Crown Prince, and Queen of Denmark.</p>
<p>“Even though the paired exchange wasn’t our initial plan it worked out so great for six people,” said Kovacic. “And three people’s lives to be saved.”</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BETHESDA, Md. (November 1, 2023) &#8212; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center hosted a transplant summit featuring surgeons from the Defense Health Agency community, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), and the private sector, all sharing insights on saving more lives by creating a larger network of potential organ donors.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Reed and Uniformed Services University’s Graduate Medical Education Program</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Army Lt. Cmdr. (Dr.) Jamie Diaz, the chief of the Organ Transplant Service at Walter Reed, welcomed the in-person and virtual summit attendees. Following Diaz’s opening remarks, retired U.S. Navy Capt. Eric Elster (Dr.), the dean of the Uniformed Services University’s (USU) F. Edward Herbert School of Medicine, spoke about the partnership between Walter Reed and USU in providing military physicians with didactic and clinical education.</p>
<p>According to Diaz, Walter Reed performs about 50 kidney transplants annually, with the capacity to perform up to 80 surgeries annually. Walter Reed’s Organ Transplant Service is ranked in the top tier of all U.S. transplant programs and has a 98-percent one-year patient and graph survival rate.</p>
<p>In addition, Walter Reed has a 5-star rated program, according to data published by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR).</p>
<p><strong>Walter Reed’s Transplant Service: Better Care and Better Outcomes for VA Patients</strong></p>
<p>Jeanie Fridley, a Department of Defense (DoD) program manager and a VA Capitol (Health Care Network liaison), and Shariff McGee – the program director for Walter Reed’s Organ Transplant Service – spoke about partnerships between the DoD and VA enhancing patient options, part of a collaborative effort to improve outcomes for VA members: permitting greater access to DHA facilities and expediting the organ pairing process.</p>
<p><strong>A Transplant Recipient’s Epic Journey</strong></p>
<p>Retired U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Douglas Jordan shared his daunting medical journey after learning that he had liver disease, which contributed to the failure of one of his kidneys. Jordan underwent twice monthly paracentesis – or abdominal taps – to remove the buildup of harmful fluids. After suffering from a temporary loss of memory on an unplanned drive to Virginia, Jordan wandered aimlessly in Richmond for a week before a bystander recognized him from a television missing person alert and contacted authorities.</p>
<p>After undergoing one liver and two kidney transplants in less than a year, Jordan regained his heath in 2013, becoming a national advocate for restructuring the organ transplant system by creating a “pay it forward” model that encourages nationwide organ donation and network sharing similar to the American Red Cross’s year-round blood drives.</p>
<p><strong>The Department of Defense Military Share Program (MSP)</strong></p>
<p>USU medical school dean Elster and Dr. Michael A. Rees, founder of the Alliance for Paired Kidney Foundation, championed the MSP.</p>
<p>Walter Reed participates in the MSP, which means that if a family member dies and the family directs one of the kidneys to be given to the U.S. military, that kidney may be transplanted into a patient here or utilized in the Baltimore VA Vision Program as part of its partnership with Walter Reed.</p>
<p>Rees, an advocate for more significant organ donation sharing domestically and internationally, would like to see the MSP become a national health care model to improve outcomes for patients within the DoD community and in the private sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When kidney disease leads to kidney failure, a transplant may be the best option. </strong>And when a patient needs a new kidney, organ donation provides a way for them to receive one and live a normal and healthy life afterward.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A new kidney can come from a living donor or a deceased donor. This kidney must meet matching criteria to reduce the chance of rejection and ensure the organ remains healthy for years to come.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Often, a family member or friend is willing to donate their kidney to their loved one. However, it’s not uncommon for their kidney to better match a different patient. When a patient and willing donor do not match, they are called an <em>incompatible pair</em>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is where paired kidney donation can help the patient find the best match possible. The incompatible pair is tested, and the paired donation process begins:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://paireddonation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apkd1.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-6948 alignnone" src="https://paireddonation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apkd1.png" alt="" width="396" height="372" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patient (1) and donor (1) are entered into the kidney matching software</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patient (2) and donor (2) are also entered into the kidney matching software</strong></li>
<li><strong>It is determined that donor (1) is a good match for patient (2), and donor (2) is a good match for patient (1)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Donor (1) donates their kidney to patient (2)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Donor (2) donates their kidney to patient (1)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Through paired kidney donation, two patients can receive new kidneys. Without it, both may stay on the waitlist and possibly never find a good match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Paired Donation Chains</strong></h4>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Paired kidney donation can also work by creating what are known as paired donation chains.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A donation chain can begin with a kidney from a non-directed donor. This is a donor (living or deceased) that is not donating on behalf of a designated patient.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These paired kidney donation chains allow for three or more patients to receive a kidney at once:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://paireddonation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apkd2.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6949" src="https://paireddonation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apkd2.png" alt="" width="624" height="378" srcset="https://paireddonation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apkd2.png 624w, https://paireddonation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apkd2-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patients (1), (2) and (3) are entered into the kidney matching software along with donors (1), (2) and (3)</strong></li>
<li><strong>The non-directed donor (1) donates to patient (1)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Donor (2) donates to patient (2)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Donor (3) then donates to patient (3) – likely an individual from the national kidney transplant waitlist</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now, three patients have new kidneys.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Paired donation chains can help make the donation process more efficient by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Providing kidney transplants for three or more patients at a time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Using a deceased donor’s kidney to help complete a paired donation chain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Allowing different patients across long distances to participate in the same donation chain</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>­</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Saving more lives</strong></h4>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Paired kidney donation has helped save more lives than ever before. The process helps provide hope to those waiting by taking patients off the waiting list.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation, our innovative software finds matches for paired donation transplants. APKD facilitated the first non-simultaneous extended altruistic donor chain in 2007, with more than 35 additional chains to follow. Our network of transplant center partners is constantly growing; our software performs match runs each day as new pairs and donors are added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Living kidney donor Ashley Baranow received travel reimbursement and compensation for lost wages through APKD’s Donor Protection Program</em></p>
<p>TOLEDO, Ohio – Living kidney donor Ashley Baranow shares her story as an example of how a comprehensive donor support program helps make kidney donation possible. As she prepared to give the gift of life to her mother, Baranow benefited from the <a href="https://paireddonation.org/donor-protection-program-details/">Donor Protection Program<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> offered by the <a href="http://paireddonation.org">Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation (APKD)</a>, an Ohio-based non-profit organization and a global leader in paired kidney donation.</p>
<p>Today in the United States, more than 80,000 people are waiting on lifesaving kidney transplants, according to the U.S. Organ Transplantation and Procurement Network (OPTN). While living donation can provide several benefits for transplant candidates, such as reducing time spent on the transplant waiting list and better long-term health outcomes, the decision to become a living kidney donor is a highly personal one that can be affected by the financial implications of travel and time off work.</p>
<p>APKD developed its Donor Protection Program to alleviate many of the financial concerns a potential donor may face. Baranow, who traveled from Texas to Illinois for testing and surgery, received travel reimbursement and compensation for lost wages. She says APKD’s program allowed her to focus on her donation and healing after her procedure.</p>
<p>“APKD’s program and kindness eased my anxiety about my husband and I taking so much time off work for testing, surgery and recovery,” said Baranow. “If I had not had their help, I would have been far more worried and would have pushed myself to go back to work before I was ready.”</p>
<p>In addition to covering transplant-related expenses, APKD’s Donor Protection Program offers comprehensive insurance for all living donors against any complications related to their surgery. This added benefit ensures APKD is offering the most comprehensive donor support program in the nation to its transplant center partners.</p>
<p>“At APKD, we believe kidney donation is such an amazing gift, the process should be free to the donor,” said <a href="https://paireddonation.org/about-us/meet-the-team/">Sue Rees</a>, chief operating officer of APKD. “You are volunteering to give up something from your own body to save another person’s life, and you shouldn’t have to shoulder financial penalties on top of the physical challenges of the surgery. We are proud to take these concerns away so that willing donors like Ashley can focus on their lifesaving gift and recovery from surgery. We wish both Ashley and her mother many years of health and happiness, and we thank Ashley for her gift of kidney donation.”</p>

<p><strong>CHICAGO – April 6, 2023</strong> <strong>–</strong> Every day as a nephrologist at Northwestern Medicine, <a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1720259617/aleksandra-gmurczyk-md">Aleksandra Gmurczyk, MD</a>, sees patients who are suffering from kidney failure. She encourages them to take their medications as prescribed, go to all their dialysis appointments and to consider the possibility of a kidney transplant so they can live healthier, longer lives.</p>
<p>As a physician who also serves patients at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, she often speaks with veterans who would rather stay on dialysis than undergo organ transplantation. Many of her patients distrust the medical system, and some can’t be convinced that a kidney transplant could transform their health. Several years ago, she began to consider how she could change her patients’ opinions if she donated one of her own kidneys to someone in need.</p>
<p>“I wanted to help someone,” Dr. Gmurczyk, 46, said. “I know people can live healthy lives with one kidney, and I know the high need for living donor organs. I hoped by donating my kidney I’d help someone, and I also wanted to inspire others to donate.”</p>
<p>Dr. Gmurczyk’s only challenge? Finding the right person to receive her kidney. She thought of all her patients, and realized her colleagues at Northwestern Memorial Hospital would have to help her make the decision.</p>
<p>“It would have been difficult to choose one person and I couldn’t choose one,” Dr. Gmurczyk said. “I decided to put my donation into a pool and hoped it would help more than one person.”</p>

<div class="pp_quote_icons">On Feb. 16, 2023, Dr. Gmurczyk kicked off a kidney paired donation, which occurs when patients have people who are willing to donate their kidneys, but they aren’t good matches with their designated recipients. Instead, the donors swap recipients, and give their kidneys to patients who are a better match. Dr. Gmurczyk donated her kidney to a hard-to-match Virginia patient she had never met, and that patient’s husband donated his kidney to a Northwestern Medicine patient in Chicago.</div>

<p>“It’s the transplant world’s version of the perfect ‘domino effect,’” said <a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1508801093/john-j-friedewald-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Friedewald, MD</a>, medical director of kidney and pancreas transplantation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “As a nephrologist, Dr. Gmurczyk understands the benefits and risks of becoming a living organ donor, and every day she sees patients who need kidneys. Our entire team was humbled to support her as she went through this process. We weren’t surprised that she chose to give the gift of life, but we were all moved by this experience.”</p>
<p>Living donor kidneys can function for about <a href="https://donatelife.net/donation/organs/kidney-donation/">twice as long</a> as deceased donor kidneys. Kidneys from living donors are also more likely to function right away, helping recipients recover more quickly.</p>
<p>Dr. Gmurczyk has chronicled her journey on social media and raised awareness about living kidney donation by sharing the facts with her followers.</p>
<p>“I see how hard life can be for patients on dialysis,” Dr. Gmurczyk said. “It’s like a part-time job with appointments that are three times a week and four hours per session. They can’t travel, go overseas and it can be tough for them to work. It’s heartbreaking.”</p>

<p>Art Reyes of Chicago knows firsthand how lifechanging a kidney failure diagnosis can be. After diabetes caused irreversible kidney damage, he began dialysis to remove waste products from his blood in November 2021. Prior to his illness, he and his wife enjoyed spending time with their many nephews and nieces. Dialysis forced him to focus more on his health and his next medical appointments, and it stole precious time from his family.</p>
<p>“It was very depressing, and you kind of lose hope,” Reyes, 51, said. “You hear all the statistics, and that it can take up to eight or 10 years to get a deceased donor. After we found out my family members weren’t a good match for me, I was thinking I should just enjoy the time I had left.”</p>
<p>Then, Reyes received a shocking call: if he was willing to receive an anonymous donor kidney, he could have surgery in two weeks.</p>
<p>“I was counting the days until surgery,” he said. “I knew the donor could back out at any time, and then the dream would be over.”</p>

<div class="pp-overflow-hidden pp-min-width-5">
<p>But what Reyes didn’t know was that Dr. Gmurczyk was committed to her donation. She prepared for surgery and then began the typical donor journey. She had a short hospital stay after the donation and didn’t know she’d helped more than one patient until weeks after surgery.</p>
<p>“It was exactly what I’d hoped for, and my recovery was exactly what we tell donors to expect,” Dr. Gmurczyk said. “I even walked home after my surgery. I returned to work two weeks after I donated and was just a little tired each night after work. I’m so glad I made the decision to donate, and I encourage others to explore the process. It’s much easier than you think.”</p>
<p>Dr. Gmurczyk may have already inspired one of her patients to get a kidney transplant. For years, she had been trying to convince the patient to consider the surgery, and following her donation, the patient decided to start the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Currently 90,000 people in the United States are waiting for a kidney donation and 85 percent of patients waiting for organ donation are waiting for a kidney, according to Donate Life America. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates more 1 in 7 adults in the United States have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/publications-resources/ckd-national-facts.html#:~:text=More%20than%201%20in%207,are%20estimated%20to%20have%20CKD.&amp;text=As%20many%20as%209%20in,not%20know%20they%20have%20CKD.">chronic kidney disease</a>.</p>
<p>“If you are a healthy adult and you think you may be an eligible kidney donor, I encourage you explore the possibility,” Dr. Gmurczyk said. “All of my appointments prior to donation were done in one day, and I only needed a short amount of down time after my surgery. I feel like I benefited as much as the recipients, because I know how much my decision to donate will help improve their lives.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Being a living donor is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have. Your kidney donation will forever change the life of a transplant recipient.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are considering this life-giving gift, you may be wondering what to expect from the process. Donation is possible if you have two healthy kidneys. You can donate directly to your recipient, or donation can occur through a kidney exchange program. The Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation’s (APKD) KidneyMatch Program is designed to find a kidney for your loved one by donating your kidney to someone else. This can occur in a simple two-way swap or in a chain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that you can live a full, normal life with one kidney, and your donated kidney can give the recipient a new lease on life. Donating a kidney is a big decision and a commitment.</p>
<h2>What To Expect Before Surgery</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You will participate in an introductory orientation and thorough medical and social-emotional evaluation. You will meet with your coordinator and surgeon, and watch training videos about the surgery and what to expect afterward. Your safety is the number one priority of the transplant center. Once you are cleared to donate, a surgery date will be scheduled or you will enter a paired exchange program.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">About a week before surgery, you will go to a pre-surgical meeting. This meeting will give you more opportunities to ask questions about your donation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Before surgery, you will need to plan for your recovery period. A social worker will help map out your recovery with the assistance of your support person. You will likely go home one or two days after surgery, but you will be under restrictions for at least the first three weeks while your body heals. If you participate in the APKD Donor Protection Program, you can get reimbursement for some or all of your lost wages during this time.</p>
<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the day of your surgery, you will be carefully monitored at the hospital. The surgeon will make a couple of small incisions and fill the abdomen with air, allowing them to insert cameras to see the kidney. A small three- to seven-inch incision in the lower abdomen is used to remove the kidney. It is then taken directly to the recipient while your surgeon finishes your procedure, and you move to the recovery room. The procedure itself lasts two to three hours.</p>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You will likely experience some pain during recovery. This is a major surgery with an open incision. You will receive pain management while you are in the hospital, and you will be sent home with medication to help you manage pain. While on pain medication, you need to rest and avoid driving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you had to travel to the transplant center, your doctor might request that you stay close by. The Donor Protection Program can pay for travel expenses and hotel stays. Staying close will allow them to monitor your health and the function of your remaining kidney.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Most kidney donors can return to regular activities two to four weeks after surgery. If you regularly play contact sports or have a highly strenuous job, your restrictions may be extended. You will need to visit the transplant center six months, 12 months and 24 months after your donation to have tests and bloodwork done.</p>
<h2>How The Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation Can Help</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout this process, the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation offers donor support. Our Donor Protection Program will compensate you for many of the expenses of this process while also providing important insurance. Our paired donation program makes it easier to find a recipient who is a match.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation, our goal is to save lives by ensuring living kidney transplants for every patient who needs one. We do this through proprietary technology that helps transplant centers pair their patients with compatible living kidney donors around the country. As part of our mission to increase the number of matches we make, we are committed to exceptional customer service.</p>
<h2>Open Communication</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In everything we do, we offer transparency and open communication. We will answer questions in a timely manner, so clinics can get assistance quickly when they are working to help their patients find matches. Our communication includes education on how to use our software best to increase the number of matches for your patients.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Support is not limited to transplant centers who use our software, either. We also are happy to answer questions from patients and potential donors. Our staff wants to guide all parties toward the best possible solution, which is lifesaving kidney donations for as many patients as possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we extend our communication to provide education to the community as a whole to ensure people understand the importance of our work and the lifesaving benefits of living kidney donation. With our help and educational materials, your clinic can educate your local community to encourage more donors to be open to non-directed donation, increasing the likelihood of finding matches for your patients.</p>
<h2>Concierge-Level Support</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At APKD, we take support beyond the standard level you would expect. We pride ourselves in providing concierge-level support to everyone who participates in our service, so transplant coordinators are guided every step of the way as they help support their own patients and patient families. We are here any time you have a question, and we will walk you through any concerns you have. With our high level of support, you can spend your valuable time with the patients in your direct care.</p>
<h2>Donor Protection Program</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While our primary focus is working with clinics to help them use our program, we are patient-focused and want to provide support to both patients and donors. Our Donor Protection Program is part of that. When someone is matched with a recipient through the APKD program, we cover the cost of any transplant-related expenses for living donors. This includes lost wages and travel-related expenses, such as food, lodging and fuel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We also protect donors through our donor insurance program. The gift of a living donor kidney gives new life to another. Non-directed donors will receive the assurance of knowing that should a family member need a kidney transplant in the future, they will be given priority placement and a guaranteed kidney from the APKD. That’s the APKD KidneyPledge<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. This is the most comprehensive donor support program available, and it will help you draw more patients to your transplant center.</p>
<h2>Contact Us Today</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have questions or are curious about how our program works, contact us conveniently online, email us at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="mailto:admin@pairedonation.org">admin@pairedonation.org</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or connect with us on social.

We are here to support you in any way possible, so reach out today to learn more about the difference APKD makes in the lives of those who give and receive the gift of life. Together, we can provide new hope and make the dream of transplantation a reality.</span></p>The post <a href="https://paireddonation.org/what-sets-apkd-apart-our-customer-service/">What Sets APKD Apart – Our Customer Service</a> first appeared on <a href="https://paireddonation.org">Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kidney transplant clinics benefit from the work of kidney transplant coordinators. These professionals help facilitate the finding of matches, contact between all parties involved and travel planning, so patients and willing donors can more quickly get matched and have the life-saving surgery. The Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation’s matching algorithm makes the job of a transplant coordinator a little easier and more fulfilling. We recently sat down with one to discuss what daily life looks like. Here are some insights into a day in the life of a transplant coordinator.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Daily Schedule</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A transplant coordinator’s daily schedule varies depending on how many transplants occur that day. On a busy day, it can start as early as 6 am or end as late as 1 am the next morning. The coordinator is responsible for registration, reporting, conducting match runs using the database software, scheduling transplants and training new centers and coordinators on how to use the software to facilitate their matches.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Because the work is so varied, transplant coordinators rarely have a set daily schedule. The tasks they do daily include reading and responding to emails, finding matches through the APKD platform and finding matches. Much of this is desk work, rather than face-to-face patient interactions</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Patient and Donor Contact</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of patient contact depends on the role of the coordinator. Those who work as clinical coordinators will have quite a bit of patient contact. Others, like the one we spoke with, work behind the scenes. They may have contact with patients, but the majority of the work is gathering documents, making matches and making referrals.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Most Challenging Part of the Work</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Finding kidney transplant matches is tricky. The coordinator we spoke with uses the APKD software to conduct match runs three days per week. Once the program finds a match, there are other factors that can cause it to fall through. Thus, much of the work is circulating back to try to find a new match or overcome a specific challenge. The coordinator must be able to think on their feet in order to work with these obstacles when they arise.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Most Rewarding Part of the Work</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While there are challenges, working as a treatment coordinator is quite rewarding. The most obvious reward is the hope that life-giving kidney transplant matches provides. This transplant coordinator felt very fulfilled when finding matches for people that are “hard to match,” and the Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation platform makes that easier. There is also a network of coordinators and other transplant professionals that keep each other connected, informed and encouraged. Transplant day text messages, a key indicator that the work done led to a saved life, are a true highlight of the work.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Working as a transplant coordinator is never boring. It requires thinking on your feet, working long hours some days and a varied schedule. Yet the payoff when people can find a match and get a kidney that will save their life is worth the long hours and dedication.</p>The post <a href="https://paireddonation.org/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-transplant-coordinator/">A Day in the Life of a Transplant Coordinator</a> first appeared on <a href="https://paireddonation.org">Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world is coming back to a place of normality, kidney patients are still wondering about the impact of COVID-19 on their health. Do they still need to avoid others to avoid the virus, or is it time to go back to normal? These are heavy questions, and they are important ones to answer as kidney patients try to protect their health in this unique time. Is COVID still a risk for kidney patients? Yes, but there are tools and strategies you can use to navigate that risk well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Antibody Levels May Help You</strong><br />
The CDC currently does not recommend routine testing of COVID-19 antibodies. The data does not seem to indicate that antibodies mean you won’t catch the virus again. However, for kidney patients, they may be a clue. People with high antibody levels appear to get milder symptoms if they catch COVID again, so antibody testing could give you some peace of mind as you move forward in this new era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Ignore Boosters</strong><br />
Boosters are an important part of protecting your health as a kidney patient. Make sure you talk to your kidney doctor to learn what boosters are recommended to protect your health. These boosters help prepare your body for the newest strains, so your body stays aware and is prepared to fight COVID if you are exposed. People with immune system deficits are recommended to get two boosters after they finish the initial shot regimen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Should I Panic if I Catch COVID?</strong><br />
No, you should not panic if you catch COVID. In fact, the latest strains of COVID are so prevalent, it is nearly impossible to go through daily life without catching it. However, you do need to take the right precautions to ensure that you do not get severely sick. Using the vaccines will help. Yes, you will feel unwell, but you are less likely to get severely ill if you are vaccinated, even as a kidney patient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, if you do get COVID, contact your primary doctor or your kidney care team right away. This will ensure you get the right medical care at the start of the illness, so it does not become severe. If you are on dialysis, make sure you notify the unit to ensure you can continue with your life-saving treatment without spreading COVID to other at-risk patients or the staff caring for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, take time to rest so you can heal. Do not push yourself through COVID, as that may increase your risk of complications. Stay hydrated, and try to eat healthy food if your appetite allows. Move your body as much as you can, and keep in contact with your medical team. These will all help you get through it with fewer complications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Take Reasonable Precautions</strong><br />
We are past the point when kidney patients need to completely isolate themselves, but you should take reasonable precautions. If someone in your home or that you spend a lot of time with tests positive, then distance as much as possible. Stay in different rooms of the home, or spend time socializing outdoors, where the risk of transmission is much lower, instead of spending time inside. Continue living your life, but be careful when you need to. However, don’t panic. If you catch COVID, you most likely will get through it, and you have a medical team ready to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s the Bottom Line?</strong><br />
The bottom line about COVID in 2022 for kidney patients is this: you are still at higher risk for complications from the virus, but this risk is similar to the risk of all other viral infections, including things like the flu. You need to take measures to protect yourself, yes, and stay updated on your vaccinations, but you do not need to live in fear. When you do catch COVID, keep your medical team aware of the situation, take care of yourself while you recover, and most likely you will weather the virus with few complications. No one can predict how any particular patient will respond to COVID, but the current treatments provide greater hope than at the start of the pandemic. Enjoy your life and family with less fear even as you navigate the world of COVID with the challenges of kidney disease.</p>The post <a href="https://paireddonation.org/is-covid-19-still-a-risk-for-kidney-patients-the-answer-is-yes/">Is COVID-19 Still a Risk?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">The <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://paireddonation.org/">Alliance for </a><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://paireddonation.org/">Paired Kidney</a><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://paireddonation.org/"> Donation</a>’s award-winning algorithm helps kidney transplant centers find effective matches. As your center evaluates the right program to use for your patients, consider these unique features of the APKD’s KidneyMatch program and app:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Strong Security</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The security of your data is our top priority. We know our donors and recipients want to know that their information is secure. KidneyMatch offers industry-standard security, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Multi-Factor Authentication is available as either a one-time code received by email or through the use of an authenticator app to keep your patients’ data secure. Hate entering a code every time you log in? If you’re on a private computer, you can always “Remember Me for 30 Days” to ease the hassle while maintaining security.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Audit Trails are created when any action occurs in our software. This gives us full insight into any concerns that arise and allows us to track down issues quickly while continuing to monitor for threats to security.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Role-Based Authorization ensures that users see only the data that they should see while doing only the things that they are allowed to do. Some folks enter data, some perform match runs, and some approve lab results. While your role controls your level of access, we also provide easy-to-use features, such as granting permissions across multiple centers if partnerships allow.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> State-of-the-Art Match Runs</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;">KidneyMatch uses internal, regional and national match runs to find potential matches and match chains for your donors and recipients. Whether you only want to match internally, have hard-to-match pairs that you’d like to match nationally or globally, or just want to help as many people as possible, KidneyMatch allows you to achieve those goals.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;">And every match run can be tailored to your needs based on matching criteria, HLA, blood type and a variety of Discretionary Exclusion Criteria (DEC) that allow you to control who is discovered as a potential match.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Extensive Patient Data</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the key features of KidneyMatch is the 80+ data points collected for every donor and 90+ data points collected for every recipient. This extensive data is used not only to find the best possible match for your patients but also to help the APKD innovate in how pairs are matched so that you are always getting better and better options. We are continually focused on integrating the latest and greatest research so that we can help you help the most patients.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Have medical charts and scans you want to add? Our system handles uploads of all types, and we partner with PurView for medical image sharing and viewing.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Fully</strong><strong>&#8211;</strong><strong>Optimized Solutions</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Forget the days of debating and arguing over which patients match. KidneyMatch presents you with optimized matches at every level from simple combinations (a single match) and internal cycles/chains to national chains and cycles with up to 10 or more pairs. KidneyMatch gives you the best options so that you can focus on what really matters &#8211; finding matches for your pairs!</span></p>
